Fourier Power Function Shapelets (`FPFS`) is an innovative estimator for the
shear responses of galaxy shape, flux, and detection. Utilizing leading-order
perturbations of shear (a vector perturbation) and image noise (a tensor
perturbation), `FPFS` determines shear and noise responses for both
measurements and detections. Unlike traditional methods that distort each
observed galaxy repeatedly, `FPFS` employs analytical shear responses of select
basis functions, including Shapelets basis and peak basis. Remarkably
efficient, `FPFS` can process approximately 1,000 galaxies within a single CPU
second. Testing under simple simulations has proven its capability to maintain
a multiplicative shear estimation bias below 0.5%, even amidst blending
challenges. For further details, refer to the `FPFS` module documentation

  (2022)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220810522L/abstract)
  correct for detection bias from pixel level by interpreting smoothed pixel
  values as a projection of signal onto a set of basis functions.

  derive the covariance matrix of FPFS measurements and corrects for noise bias
  to second-order. In addition, it derives the correction for selection bias.

+ **version 1:** [Li et. al
  (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.481.4445L/abstract)
  build up the FPFS formalism based on
  [Fourier_Quad](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5514) and [polar
