# Examples

This directory gives some examples on simulating galaxy images with
[Galsim](https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim); and galaxy detection and
shape estimation with [FPFS](https://github.com/mr-superonion/FPFS).

## Simulations
+ [example 1](./simulation_noise_image.ipynb) shows how to simulate pure noise
  with Galsim.

+ [example 2](./simulation_galaxy_basic.ipynb) shows how to simulate galaxies
  with Galsim.

+ [example 3](./simulation_beyond_affine.ipynb) shows simulation of
  distortion beyond affine approximation

## Isolated Galaxies

+ [example 1](./isolated_measure_shear.ipynb) shows how to measure shear from
  noiseless galaxy images (fix center of isotropy).

+ [example 2](./isolated_detect_and_measure.ipynb) shows how to detect galaxy
  measure shear from galaxy images.

+ [example 3](./noise_bias_Hessian.ipynb) shows the Hessian matrix for
  noise bias correction.

## Blended Galaxies
